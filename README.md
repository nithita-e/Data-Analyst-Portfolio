# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
This repository contains my projects from every step of my data analyst career path, through these three courses : 

- Python for Data Analyst  from : DataCamp (2024)
- SQL for Data Analyst from : DataCamp (2024)
- Data Analyst Professional : DataRockie (2023)
and also my own project analysis.

Even though I am full with passion to learned and improved on both of hards and soft skills for Data Analyst role, I'm sure that I still have some mistakes on these project. So, if you have any suggestions, a better solution, or a different perspective. Please let me know, I'm pleased to improve.

Thank you so much
